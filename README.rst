Marrow IO
=========

Marrow IO is a standalone implementation of an I/O loop for asynchronous
network applications. It is possible to create applications with it that handle
thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.

The design of Marrow IO was mainly influenced by two better known frameworks,
Twisted and Tornado. Marrow IO seeks to combine the strengths of both while
maintaining a clean API and adding support for standards like PEP 3148.
